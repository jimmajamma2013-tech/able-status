# ABLE — what is happening right now

**Last updated just now.**
_If that says more than about 10 minutes while work is running, this page has fallen behind and
should not be trusted. It is supposed to update itself._

## In one line

2 things are being built right now, and the build list is deliberately on hold with 14 jobs kept safe while finished work gets checked. 5 finished pieces of work are waiting to be checked and added in.

## Is anything wrong?

- The build list is paused **on purpose** — not because anything broke. Nothing has been lost; every job is kept and will resume.
- 5 pieces of finished work are waiting to be checked. That is why the list is paused: building faster than checking is how good work gets wiped out by accident.
- The second Claude account has used 91% of its week, so it is being kept in reserve for emergencies rather than doing routine work.

## Being worked on right now

- 2 jobs are running (going 17:31, going 07:39).
- ⚠️ The written description below may be out of date — it lists 0 but 2 jobs are actually running:


## Waiting for you

- GITHUB ACTIONS — the cause is now GitHub's own sentence
- GITHUB BRANCH PROTECTION on able-rebuild-v1 needs GITHUB PRO first — measured: gh api …/branches/able-rebuild-v1/protection answers "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature"
- OPENAI CREDITS
- REPORTED, not asked: the repo-local git identity `t <t@t>` was removed at 20:5x; commits are authored James Cuthbert from 27b5d6a99c on. One line restores the placeholder if it was deliberate.
- WHEN THE FACTORY FOLDS

## The numbers, in plain words

- **2 jobs** being built right now
- **14 jobs** waiting in the list (on hold on purpose)
- **5 finished pieces** waiting to be checked and added in
- Claude account A has used **68%** of its week — it refills **Sep 18 at 7pm**
- Claude account B has used **91%** of its week — it refills **Sep 22 at 10:59pm**
- ⚠️ all three Claude accounts are separate and reachable

## Every model lane we can reach

| Lane | State | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude A** | 68% of its week used | The one to spend. Routine work goes here. Refills Sep 18 at 7pm. |
| **Claude B** | 91% of its week used | Nearly spent, and its top tier is closed until it refills Sep 22 at 10:59pm. Held for emergencies only. |
| **Claude C** | not a separate account | Signed into the same login as A, so work on it is billed to A. One subscription is unreachable until it is signed in properly. |
| **Codex / Astra** | limit reached | Nothing can be sent here until it resets. |
| **Gemini · Grok · Kimi** | no meter exists | They can still be CALLED. What cannot be done is knowing how much is left — none of them publish a usage number. So they are used for bounded second opinions, never for work the build depends on. |
| **Local models** | free, no limit | Three models on this machine. Good for mechanical work that needs no judgement; one heavy one at a time, because memory is the limit rather than money. |

⛔ **A lane with no meter is shown as "no meter", never as zero.** A broken reading and an unused
account look identical from the outside, and only one of them is safe to spend against.

delivered-but-unfolded product branches, and pauses immediately if the next packet touches a file an
unfolded branch touches. Builders outrunning integration is how a folded P0 gets erased.

## candidates ready for verdict / fold
- THE INTEGRATED FOLD ④ @ c600dfd033 (pushed) — r1's two blockers closed at 05b9287474 (B1: the lead Work draws its people through originalOf, one-served-lineage exits 0 on the served HEAD; B2: the adapter's two stand-ins deleted, 0 hits for any table or kind derivation outside the domain, 27 of 30 releases compose identically and the three that changed are declared). Named, not proven: providers/manifestationKind.ts still derives a kind outside the domain; Deezer's embed capability disagrees with the stage; Mother draws no All-credits door; lineage does not yet ride the merge step. r2 VERDICT RUNNING on A.
- fold-bc-20260916 @ 8275960165 — r3 PASS (B3 closed; nothing r2 held regressed); FOLD-ELIGIBLE for the integrated fold ④ only
- lane A provider data @ 48fe3fc28c — r3 PASS 8·7; waits in the integrated fold ④
- BANDCAMP-IDS @ 3499e78b57 (origin/worktree-agent-afa25af8ff9958d25) — r1 PASS; folds behind the consent law in ④
- cand-claim-20260917 @ 0345ac0544 — the two-defect fix is STRANDED as 25 staged files in /Users/jamescuthbert/able-work/cand-claim (its builder died with the 14:40Z window kill); needs a resume builder to commit, then ONE fresh verdict
- night-claim-screen-20260917 @ fba480c587 — RETURNED by lane review (35 findings); does not enter a candidate until its fixes land
- LANE MATERIALS — STRANDED again: 26 dirty files in /Users/jamescuthbert/Able/.claude/worktrees/agent-ad409ed963fb3ce99, no commit (its in-session builder died with the 14:40Z window kill); needs a resume builder

## running lanes
- FINISHED, UNRECORDED — pid 8055 is not in the process table and the seat has not written its outcome yet: DUAL at 834 and WIDE at 1440, r1, on dual-wide-20260918 @ d0391b777d — the dimension capping product at 4. The builder recomposed the Work into two columns and WITHDREW the Room (its own opening already has tablet and desktop layouts; the frame pushed 159 px of content). The root seat measured this SHA first: the Work RECOMPOSED at 834 and 1440 (2 columns, widest band 0.58 of the viewport) where canonical is STRETCHED, the Room unchanged, 390 untouched. The verifier weighs the builder's own doubt — the artwork appearing twice at the top of a Work
- 2 headless claude process(es) in the table at 2026-09-18T01:52:42.015Z (pid 11295 up 17:31, pid 27271 up 07:39) — 0 of them recorded as lanes above

## blockers
- THE ORDER FROM THE FOUNDER (2026-09-17 ~18:2x): keep moving through Maribou to 11/10, all models, no stopping, never reopening the Room plan or starting a broad audit. The chain, with ④ LANDED at e509cadc8b: c-census + c-identity merged onto canonical by root (one import hunk, one registry hunk) → one fresh verdict on the merged head → fast-forward → RETURN-EXACT + the sounding door (building on A) → its verdict → the Work opening with QuickLaunch → Materials from the real sleeve → Groove List → DUAL/WIDE → People/Relationship → Film V2. The scoreboard audit stays paused. B is under its weekly floor (9% left); C has 4% above its floor; A carries the builders and verdicts.
- ACCOUNT A IS AT ITS SESSION CEILING (77% of the five-hour window; the guard's ceiling is 78%): no new builder or in-session fan-out on A until the window rolls (~19:40 BST). The root seat's own work on A stays light (git reconciliation, packets, publishing). Account C carries the identity r3 builder and sits ~8% above its weekly floor; Account B rests.
- THE PRODUCT QUEUE IS STILL PAUSED BY RULE — 14 packets held in QUEUE/tasks-paused.txt, none lost. Backpressure counts delivered-but-unfolded product branches (lane A · fold-bc · Bandcamp · c-census · c-identity = 5) against a threshold of 2. The integrated fold ④ is the one action that clears it.
- Account B rests at 91% weekly with Fable spent (resets Sep 22) — nothing dispatched there. Account C is at 77% weekly (23% left, floor 12%; resets Sep 19 23:00): the guard now says Opus for its next dispatches; the two Fable lanes above were the last Fable ones on C.
- Both root windows were killed at 14:40Z. The A seat resumed at ~14:45Z; the B seat has not. The stranded work is SNAPSHOTTED as refs (no gates, worktrees untouched): refs/wip/A/2026-09-17-materials = 752c850b62 (20 files) · refs/wip/A/2026-09-17-cand-claim-fix = 42a442f92f (24 files).
- OWED: one bounded independent verdict on the status bridge itself (oldest open debt on this seat). And the kernel §2 names claimSoundOwner/releaseSoundOwner in audioBus.ts which do not exist in src/ — a doc-vs-code mismatch the cand-play verifier found.

## needs James
- GITHUB ACTIONS — the cause is now GitHub's own sentence (gh api …/check-runs/105264398173/annotations): "The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased. Please check the 'Billing & plans' section in your settings." Action: github.com/settings/billing on jimmajamma2013-tech → fix the failed payment or raise the Actions spending limit → re-run one workflow on able-rebuild-v1. ~3 minutes. Until then every remote check is meaningless; the native Definition-of-Done runs locally per commit (tsc · vitest · build-check · eye-check · lineage), and the factory branch's act-based fallback (scripts/factory/ci-local.sh) is UNPROVEN until one job runs end to end.
- GITHUB BRANCH PROTECTION on able-rebuild-v1 needs GITHUB PRO first — measured: gh api …/branches/able-rebuild-v1/protection answers "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature" (the repo is private on the free plan). So: on the same billing visit, upgrade the jimmajamma2013-tech account to GitHub Pro (about $4/month), then settings/branches → rule for able-rebuild-v1 → block force pushes and deletions. This is the control that cannot be talked around; four verifiers each routed around a local hook. ~4 minutes with the Actions fix.
- OPENAI CREDITS (blocks the cross-family GPT attack; the key is on disk): platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing → add credits. ~2 minutes.
- REPORTED, not asked: the repo-local git identity `t <t@t>` was removed at 20:5x; commits are authored James Cuthbert from 27b5d6a99c on. One line restores the placeholder if it was deliberate.
- WHEN THE FACTORY FOLDS (not before): `supabase login` in a terminal (~1 min) · `sentry-cli login` and confirm the Railway DSN (~3 min) · Replay account + MCP connection (~5 min) · Greptile dashboard: enable T-Rex for UI PRs only (~2 min) · Mobbin + Refero accounts and a full Figma seat (~10 min) · Cursor: sign in, connect GitHub, create Project ABLE (~5 min) · Conductor and Augment Intent sign-ins for the bake-off (~5 min each) · Lyssna for human taste tests, later.

## next actions (in order)
- the DUAL/WIDE verdict (A, Opus, running) decides whether the Work's two-column recomposition folds on its own; the Room's DUAL/WIDE becomes its own slice either way
- ONE SLICE, TWO LAWS: route the room's images (and the arrival hero) through Able's own origin — closes the definitive Room's seven third-party requests AND the hero's 4,153 ms, re-measured by the consent spec and node scripts/mobile-asset-budget.mjs; packet to be written from docs/audits/2026-09-18-two-gates-one-cause/RECORD.md
- the consent fork on the Room's audio warm-up — packet written; warm through Able's own origin only if the tap stays instant, otherwise report numbers for a founder ruling
- Materials from the REAL sleeve → the Groove List → People/Relationship → Film V2
- the factory branch after a PASS on its exact repaired SHA (r1–r5 RETURNED; r6 running against 24028bb5d0); its lane gate returned and fixed on canonical at a3aaff1d58 — the seat must prefix CLAUDE_LANE=A-FACTORY · the two-day comparison 2026-09-19 ~21:00 BST
